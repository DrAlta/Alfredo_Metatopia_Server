# Alfredo_Metatopia_Server
A P2P virtual world based on [Raynet from Solipsis](https://hal.inria.fr/inria-00337057/document), written in Rust.

ToDo.
1. Port Raynet from C++ to Rust.
2. Make basic chat server.
3. Make a client to connect to chat server
4. Add [Newdon1](https://github.com/DrAlta/Newdon1) to support physics for a basic sim.
5. Add scripting to server(Lua modified to use fixpoint instead of floats? some Forth variant that uses objects as a base type?)
6. Add [Newdon2](https://github.com/DrAlta/Newdon2) to support advance physics.
7. Screw Over Users.
8. Profit!
